# librespot-android

This is a demo application to demonstrate that it is possible to run [librespot-java](https://github.com/librespot/librespot-java) on an Android device. The app provides basic functionalities to login and then to play a custom URI, pause/resume, skip next and previous, but all features could be implemented. 

This repo also contains some useful modules that contain Android-compatible sinks and decoders that you might want to use in your app.
